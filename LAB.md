# Assignment Overview: Lab 2

- Your assignment will be to create an "About Me" HTML and JS project.

## Instructions

1. Use Html (and what CSS you know), to allow people to quickly learn a few things about you, 
such as a short bio, my education, an overview of my job experience, and my goals.

1. Allow the user to input their name, so that the program is personalized to their experience

1. Give the visitors to my About Me page a guessing game that shows how fun-loving and interesting you are, 
and maybe include things about yourself that would not ordinarily appear in a portfolio page.
    * Use a button to "start" the guessing game.
    * Use a prompt to ask them a question
    * Notify them after each question
        * If they got it wrong, tell them so, how many guesses left, and maybe a hint. You can use alert, or add to re-prompt
        * If they got it right, alert them and then modify the page to show the completed successfully
        * If they exhausted all guesses, modify page to show they did not complete
        * Allow them to click the button again
       
### Technical Requirements for "About Me"

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed.
- Your JS file contains a 'use strict' declaration at the top. Always.
- Design a guessing game about you that involves **FIVE** yes/no questions. Be creative and fun and whimsical. Or not. It's up to you! It's your project!
- The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either `.toUpperCase()` or `.toLowerCase()` used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.
- Useful and descriptive `console.log()` messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.
- Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have
- Add, Commit, Push process is being followed; it is evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.

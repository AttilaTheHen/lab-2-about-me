# Lab 2 - Revision 1

Lab 2 consists of a simple "About Me" webpage. It has some basic biographical information, along with several games that the user can play to find out more about me - Injoong.

## Instructions and info
* Clicking "PLAY" for either of the first two games (_Yes or No_ and _Favorite Number_) will launch the game.
* Both of these games use browser alerts and prompts to ask the user a series of questions.
* At the end of each game, a "Results" message will be outputted onto the HTML - for _Yes or No_, it's a final score (out of 5), and for _Favorite Number_, it's a simple win/lose message.
